Reworks Enchanted Books with the following changes:

Enchanted Books can no longer be combined

Enchanted Books can no longer have more than one level on a book

The vanilla mechanics regarding how an enchanted item will not receive an increase to its current enchantment 
level if the applied item is lower than the enchanted items level has been removed. Regardless of the current
level of the enchanted item, adding a book to it will always increase the level by 1 until it reaches the 
maximum enchanted level
